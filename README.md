# AP4 Colourful Theme

![icon](icon.png)

GitHub repository to maintain my own VS Code theme.

Mostly for personal usage, however, feel free to download and use it in your own VSCode setup.

For an easier time installing the theme, [install it through the VSCode Marketplace extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ap4.ap4-colourful-theme).

Optimized for Python/TypeScript
